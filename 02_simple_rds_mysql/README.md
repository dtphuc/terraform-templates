## How it works
```
terraform init          # Initialize a new or existing Terraform configuration
terraform plan          # Generate and show an execution plan
terraform apply         # Builds or changes infrastructure
terraform show          # Inspect Terraform state or plan
terraform plan -destroy # Generate and show an execution plan to check what will be removed
