# Terraform template for AWS RDS MySQL
You need to check and change the vars.tf as your need.

Amazon ElastiCache is a web service that makes it easy to deploy, operate, and scale an in-memory data store or cache in the cloud. The service improves the performance of web applications by allowing you to retrieve information from fast, managed, in-memory data stores, instead of relying entirely on slower disk-based databases. Amazon ElastiCache supports two open-source in-memory engines:
- Redis
- Memcache

## Prerequisites
- Apply 01_vpc first
- AWS account
- AWS IAM access key
- AWS IAM secret key
- AWS region

## Installing
Terraform must first be installed on your machine
https://www.terraform.io/intro/getting-started/install.html

## How it works
```
terraform init          # Initialize the Terraform configuration
terraform plan          # See the resources which will be created
terraform apply         # Create the resources defined in all .tf files
terraform show          # Show the resources
terraform plan -destroy # See what will be removed
terraform destroy       # Remove the resources
```

## The below items will be created:
- 1 cluster AWS ElastiCache with 1 master node and 1 replica node on each availability zone
