# Terraform template for AWS Identity and Access Management
You need to check and change the vars.tf as your need.

AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources for your users. You use IAM to control who can use your AWS resources (authentication) and what resources they can use and in what ways (authorization).


## Prerequisites

terraform show          # Show the resources
terraform plan -destroy # See what will be removed
terraform destroy       # Remove the resources
```
